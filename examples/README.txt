Backends = Helper code to facilitate integration with platforms/graphics api (used by Examples + should be used by your app).
Examples = Standalone applications showcasing integration with platforms/graphics api.

Some Examples have extra README files in their respective directory, please check them too!

Once Gui is running (in either examples or your own application/game/engine),
run and refer to Gui::ShowDemoWindow() in demo.cpp for the end-user API.
